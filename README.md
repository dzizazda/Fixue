The newly found "GitHub farming" strategy is harmful for every part of the ecosystem :

* Firstly to the repo owners & code reviewers, for the waste of time it causes.
* Secondly to the tech, which is being slowed down by this waste.
* Also to the researchers, whose metrics are skewed.
* Then to the developpers with meaningful contributions, who are cheated.
* Lastly to the user, a victim of injustice whose allocation may be reduced to feed greedy farmers.

This strategy needs to be proven ineffective from the very beginning to prevent its spread & protect Open Source.
