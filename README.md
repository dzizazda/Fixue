The newly found "GitHub farming" strategy is harmful for every part of the ecosystem :

* Firstly to the repo owners & code reviewers, for the waste of time it causes.
* Secondly to the tech, which is being slowed down by this waste.
* Also to the researchers, whose metrics are skewed.
* Then to the developpers with meaningful contributions, who are cheated.
* Lastly to the user, a victim of injustice whose allocation may be reduced to feed greedy farmers.

The only winners from "GitHub farming" are the "GitHub farmers", at the expense of everybody else.

This strategy needs to be proven ineffective from the very beginning to prevent its spread & protect Open Sourcing.
